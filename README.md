This is a beta software, not recommended for production systems.

## Introduction 

This is a device plugin implementation that enables the registration of HPE Slingshot Cassini NICs in a Kubernetes cluster for compute workload.

## Requirements

##### - Kubernetes v1.30 or higher

##### - CXI Services Enabled

This step must be executed for every node and every Slingshot NIC that serves the Kubernetes cluster:
```
cxi_service enable -d cxiX -s 1
```

##### - Enable Mutating Admission Policy

Mutating Admission Policy is an alpha feature released in Kubernetes v1.30. As with any alpha feature, it must be explicitly enabled before usage. Add the following lines to /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml:
```
- --feature-gates=MutatingAdmissionPolicy=true
- --runtime-config=admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1=true
```

##### - Multus CNI 

Since we need multiple NICs, we are going to use Multus CNI (a CNI meta-plugin) that enables attaching multiple network interfaces to pods.
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/master/deployments/multus-daemonset-thick.yml
```

##### - Whereabouts CNI

Whereabouts is an IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plugin that assigns IP addresses cluster-wide.  
```
git clone https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/whereabouts
cd whereabouts
kubectl apply \
    -f doc/crds/daemonset-install.yaml \
    -f doc/crds/whereabouts.cni.cncf.io_ippools.yaml \
    -f doc/crds/whereabouts.cni.cncf.io_overlappingrangeipreservations.yaml
```

## Deployment

Alpha-version image available at `hub.docker.hpecorp.net/caio.davi/cxi-k8s-device-plugin:0.1`. 
The device plugin should run in every node with available Cassini NICs, in order to make them available to the K8s cluster. The easiest way of doing so is to create a Kubernetes DaemonSet:

```
kubectl apply \
    -f ./deploy/NetworkAttachmentDefinition \
    -f ./deploy/MutatingAdmissionPolicy \ 
    -f ./deploy/hpecxi-device-plugin-ds.yaml
```

## Pod Resources

```yaml
resources:
  requests: 
    beta.hpe.com/cxi: 1
```

> #### Make sure the IPAM definitions in the `./deploy/NetworkAttachmentDefinition` are follwoing your cluster network requirements.
